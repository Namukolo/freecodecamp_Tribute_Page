            Yvette Young (born June 28, 1991) is an American musician from San
            Jose, California. She is currently the front-woman for the math rock
            band Covet.
          </p>
          <p>
            The young Californian started out playing classical music on violin
            and piano from an early age, though by her own admission neither
            instrument had particularly resonated with her. She describes the
            switch to guitar many years later as arguably her greatest
            light-bulb moment, one which allowed her to delve deep into new
            worlds of self-expression and lose herself in the calmness of her
            own hypnotic noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having now found her true calling, it wouldn’t take her long to
            start creating and performing, eventually establishing herself as
            one of the most exciting players of a new generation, fronting
            Covet. Her connection to her instrument is as personal as it gets.
            It would be her salvation…
